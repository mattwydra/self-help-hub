# Self-Help Hub

## Overview
Self-Help Hub is a personal self-care web application designed to provide emotional support and motivation. Users can select a topic they need help with, such as heartbreak, motivation, or anxiety, and receive curated content based on what has personally helped me. Future iterations of this project will include an AI-powered chatbot trained on personalized responses.

## Features
- **Interactive Circular Menu**: Users select topics via an aesthetically pleasing circular button layout.
- **Dynamic Background**: Background images smoothly fade in and out, providing a calming atmosphere.
- **Custom Responses**: Clicking on a topic leads to unique, tailored responses, including quotes, images, videos, or personal advice.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new topics and content without breaking the layout.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Integration**: Implement a personalized LLM (large language model) to generate responses tailored to the creator's experiences.
- **Database Support**: Store and retrieve user interactions to provide a more dynamic experience.
- **Theming Options**: Allow users to customize the visual style to match their preferences.

## Features in progress right now:


### Social Anxiety

1. **Quick Self-Talk Phrases:**
   - "I've handled difficult conversations before and survived."
   - "People are usually focused on themselves, not judging me."
   - "I don't need to be perfect to be accepted."
   - "This feeling will pass - it always does."

2. **Breathing Technique:** 
   The 4-7-8 Method: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. This activates the parasympathetic nervous system and can help reduce anxiety quickly.

3. **Outside-the-Box Activity:**
   "Social Anxiety Soundtrack" - Create a playlist of your favorite upbeat songs. Before entering anxiety-provoking situations, listen to one song while striking power poses (hands on hips, standing tall). This combines music therapy with physical posture change to boost confidence through both auditory and proprioceptive channels.

### Heartbreak

1. **Future Orientation Activity:**
   "The Empty Canvas" - Provide a digital canvas where users can add symbolic images representing things they want in their future. Start with a completely blank canvas and prompt them to add elements one by one (career goals, hobbies, places to visit, new experiences). This visually demonstrates that their future is unwritten and full of possibilities not dependent on their past relationship.

2. **Identity Reclamation:**
   "Who Was I Before?" exercise - Guide users to list activities, preferences, and parts of themselves they had before the relationship or that got diminished during it. Create a concrete action plan to reclaim one small element each day.

### Loneliness

1. **Connection Without People:**
   "The Nature Bridge" - A guided visualization where users mentally connect with the natural world. Include prompts about feeling the shared atoms between their body and the trees, remembering that birds, animals, and plants are all around us in a connected ecosystem.

2. **Letter to Self:**
   Provide a template for users to write a compassionate letter to themselves from their future self, who has moved through this lonely period. Prompt them with questions about what wisdom they'd share and what they'd want their current self to know.

3. **Micro-Connection Challenge:**
   Suggest making one tiny human connection each day - smile at a cashier, comment on a social media post meaningfully, send a quick message to an old friend with no pressure for response. Frame it as building "connection muscle" gradually.
