# Self-Help Hub

## Overview
Self-Help Hub is a personal self-care web application designed to provide emotional support and motivation. Users can select a topic they need help with, such as heartbreak, motivation, or anxiety, and receive curated content based on what has personally helped me. Future iterations of this project will include an AI-powered chatbot trained on personalized responses.

## Features
- **Interactive Circular Menu**: Users select topics via an aesthetically pleasing circular button layout.
- **Dynamic Background**: Background images smoothly fade in and out, providing a calming atmosphere.
- **Custom Responses**: Clicking on a topic leads to unique, tailored responses, including quotes, images, videos, or personal advice.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new topics and content without breaking the layout.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Integration**: Implement a personalized LLM (large language model) to generate responses tailored to the creator's experiences.
- **Database Support**: Store and retrieve user interactions to provide a more dynamic experience.
- **Theming Options**: Allow users to customize the visual style to match their preferences.
