# How to find yourself (Idea 1)

Similar implementation to goal-setting and unmotivated. Will be a series of journal entries, focused on gathering information. After the entries are recorded, have an LLM implemented to take the information and create a story that tells the user what their future might look like based on their responses. 

### Questions:
1. 

Then, 3 options appear:
1. "How do I get there"
2. "Re-generate"
3. "I don't like this future"

## How do I get there
- LLM generates concrete steps based on a formulaic plan (general goal-setting advice).
- Also tailored help for the user's situation.

## Re-generate
- User can enter any additional information into a new text box.

## I don't like this future
- User can go back and edit their responses.

# How to find yourself (Idea 2)

The second idea would be to use Robert Greene's idea of your life's task, and hepling the user go through the process of figuring out what that is, based on what Greene recommends in his book, "Mastery".
