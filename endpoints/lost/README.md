# How to find yourself (Idea 1)

Similar implementation to goal-setting and unmotivated. Will be a series of journal entries, focused on gathering information. After the entries are recorded, have an LLM implemented to take the information and create a story that tells the user what their future might look like based on their responses. 

## Question outline:
1. **Clarify your vision** – What excites you? What feels right?  
2. **Get sensory and emotional details** – What does a good day feel like? What do you hear, see, smell?  
3. **Understand your motivations** – What do you deeply care about? What keeps you going?  
4. **Identify roadblocks** – What’s stopping you? How do you usually get in your own way?  

### **Part 1: The Vision**  
1. Imagine you wake up in a future where you're living a life that truly excites you. What’s the first thing you notice when you open your eyes?  
2. Where are you? Describe your surroundings.  
3. What’s the first thing you do in the morning that makes you feel fulfilled?  

### **Part 2: The Day-to-Day**  
4. What kind of work or creative projects are you engaged in?  
5. Who do you spend your time with, and how do they make you feel?  
6. When you take a break, where do you go? What do you do to recharge?  
7. What’s a challenge you face in this future? How do you overcome it?  
8. At the end of the day, what makes you feel proud or at peace?  

### **Part 3: The Deep Stuff**  
9. What values guide your decisions in this future?  
10. What’s something you *don’t* do anymore that used to hold you back?  
11. What’s a moment in this future that reminds you why you worked for it?  

### **Part 4: Getting There**  
12. If you could take one step toward this future today, what would it be?

Then, 3 options appear:
1. "How do I get there"
2. "Re-generate"
3. "I don't like this future"

## How do I get there
- LLM generates concrete steps based on a formulaic plan (general goal-setting advice).
- Also tailored help for the user's situation.

## Re-generate
- User can enter any additional information into a new text box.

## I don't like this future
- User can go back and edit their responses.

# How to find yourself (Idea 2)

The second idea would be to use Robert Greene's idea of your life's task, and hepling the user go through the process of figuring out what that is, based on what Greene recommends in his book, "Mastery".
