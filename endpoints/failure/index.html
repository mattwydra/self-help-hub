        <p>Welcome to this interactive exercise designed to help you transform how you view failure. Through reflection,
            reframing, and visualization, you'll discover how failures can become powerful stepping stones toward
            success.</p>

        <div class="progress-container">

    <div id="step1" class="container step">
        <h2>Step 1: Understanding Your Relationship with Failure</h2>

        <p>Before we begin, take a moment to reflect on how you currently view failure. Select the statement that best
            describes your current mindset:</p>

        <div>
            <input type="radio" id="mindset1" name="mindset" value="fixed">
            <label for="mindset1">Failure is evidence of my limitations and should be avoided.</label>
        </div>

        <div>
            <input type="radio" id="mindset2" name="mindset" value="transitioning">
            <label for="mindset2">I know failure can teach me things, but it still feels terrible when it
                happens.</label>
        </div>

        <div>
            <input type="radio" id="mindset3" name="mindset" value="growth">
            <label for="mindset3">I see failure as a necessary part of learning and growth.</label>

    <!-- Step 2: Reflect on a Recent Failure -->
    <div id="step2" class="container step hidden">
        <h2>Step 2: Reflect on a Recent Failure</h2>

        <p>Think about a recent experience where you feel you failed or didn't meet expectations (your own or others).
            Describe what happened:</p>

        <textarea id="failure-description"
            placeholder="Describe what happened, how you felt, and why you consider it a failure..."></textarea>

    <div id="step3" class="container step hidden">
        <h2>Step 3: Reframing Your Experience</h2>

        <p>Now, let's reframe this experience. Answer these questions:</p>

            <textarea id="lessons"

    <!-- Step 4: Inspiring Failure Stories -->
    <div id="step4" class="container step hidden">
        <h2>Step 4: Famous Failure Stories</h2>

        <p>You're not alone. Many successful people experienced significant failures on their path to success:</p>

        <div class="story">
            <h3>J.K. Rowling</h3>
            <p>Before Harry Potter became a global phenomenon, J.K. Rowling was a single mother living on welfare. Her
                first Harry Potter manuscript was rejected by 12 publishers before being accepted. She later said,
                "Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me
                things about myself that I could have learned no other way."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story">
            <h3>Thomas Edison</h3>
            <p>When working on the light bulb, Edison made over 1,000 unsuccessful attempts. When asked about his
                failures, he famously said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." Each
                "failure" brought him one step closer to success.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story">
            <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
            <p>"I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted
                to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that
                is why I succeed."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <label for="inspiration">Which of these stories resonates with you most, and why?</label>
            <textarea id="inspiration" placeholder="Share your thoughts..."></textarea>
        </div>

        <div class="next-step">
            <button onclick="nextStep(4, 5)">Continue</button>

    <!-- Step 5: Building Your Failure Portfolio -->
    <div id="step5" class="container step hidden">
        <h2>Step 5: Create Your Failure Portfolio</h2>

        <p>A "Failure Portfolio" celebrates your failures as valuable experiences that contributed to who you are today.
            Add at least two entries:</p>

        <div id="portfolio-entries">
            <div class="portfolio-item">
                <div>
                    <label for="failure1">Failure Experience #1:</label>
                    <input type="text" id="failure1" placeholder="Brief description of the failure">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <label for="growth1">The Growth It Provided:</label>

    <!-- Step 6: Future Failure Visualization -->
    <div id="step6" class="container step hidden">
        <h2>Step 6: Visualizing "Failing Forward"</h2>

        <p>Think about something you're currently afraid to try because you might fail. Let's visualize how you could
            "fail forward" in this situation:</p>

        <div>
            <label for="fear">What are you afraid to try?</label>
            <input type="text" id="fear" placeholder="E.g., applying for a promotion, learning a new skill, etc.">
        </div>

        <div>
            <label for="visualization">Imagine you try and things don't go as planned. How specifically could you use
                that experience to grow and eventually succeed?</label>
            <textarea id="visualization"
                placeholder="Describe how you would learn from this potential setback and use it to move forward..."></textarea>
        </div>

        <p>Now, identify three small steps you could take toward this goal, where failing would be a manageable learning
            opportunity:</p>

        <div>
            <label for="step1">Step 1 (Smallest challenge):</label>
            <input type="text" id="small-step1">
        </div>

        <div>
            <label for="step2">Step 2 (Medium challenge):</label>
            <input type="text" id="small-step2">
        </div>

        <div>
            <label for="step3">Step 3 (Bigger challenge):</label>
            <input type="text" id="small-step3">
        </div>

        <div class="next-step">
            <button onclick="nextStep(6, 7)">Complete Activity</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Completion Message -->
    <div id="step7" class="container step hidden">
        <div id="completion-message">
            <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
            <p>You've completed the Embracing Failure activity. Remember that every setback is an opportunity for growth
                and learning. By reframing failures as stepping stones, you're developing a resilient growth mindset.
            </p>
            <p>Consider saving your reflections from this activity to revisit when you face challenges in the future.
