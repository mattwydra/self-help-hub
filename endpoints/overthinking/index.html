                <h3>Reframe Your Thoughts</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Overthinking often creates catastrophic narratives. Let's practice turning those thoughts around:</p>

            <div class="perspective-shift">
                <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "I keep making the same mistakes and I'll never improve."</p>
                <p><strong>Try:</strong> "I notice patterns in my behavior that I can work on, which shows I'm
                    self-aware and growing."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="perspective-shift">
                <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Everyone at that party was judging me for what I said."</p>
                <p><strong>Try:</strong> "People are generally focused on themselves, not analyzing my every word."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="exercise">
                <h4>Try it yourself:</h4>
                <p>Write down a thought you've been overthinking, then create two alternative perspectives:</p>
                <textarea placeholder="My overthinking thought..."
                    style="width: 100%; padding: 10px; height: 60px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"></textarea>
                <textarea placeholder="Alternative perspective 1..."
                    style="width: 100%; padding: 10px; height: 60px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"></textarea>
                <textarea placeholder="Alternative perspective 2..."
                    style="width: 100%; padding: 10px; height: 60px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"></textarea>
            </div>
        </div>

                <h3>The 5-5-5 Reality Check</h3>
            </div>
            <p>When your mind is racing with worst-case scenarios, try this grounding technique:</p>

            <div class="exercise">
                <h4>Ask yourself these questions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Will this matter in 5 hours?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Will this matter in 5 weeks?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Will this matter in 5 years?</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>This simple exercise helps put your concerns in perspective and often reveals that many of our
                    worries are temporary.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Breathing Reset</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Overthinking creates physical tension. Follow this breathing animation for 1 minute to break the cycle:
            </p>

            <div class="breathing-animation"></div>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Breathe in as the circle expands. Breathe out as it contracts.</p>

            <p>Research shows that controlled breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which helps calm
                your mind and reduce overthinking.</p>
        </div>

                <h3>The Observer Technique</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Step outside your thoughts by becoming an observer:</p>

            <div class="exercise">
                <h4>Try this now:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Imagine watching your thoughts like clouds passing in the sky</li>
                    <li>Notice each thought without judging it or attaching to it</li>
                    <li>Say to yourself: "I notice I'm having the thought that..." before each worry</li>
                    <li>Remember: You are not your thoughts. You are the observer of your thoughts.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h3>Thought Dump & Transform</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Sometimes overthinking happens because we're trying to hold too much in our heads:</p>

            <div class="exercise">
                <h4>The process:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Dump:</strong> Write everything you're overthinking about for 3 minutes without stopping
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Circle:</strong> Which of these thoughts are actually in your control?</li>
                    <li><strong>Transform:</strong> For each circled thought, write one small action you could take</li>
                    <li><strong>Release:</strong> For thoughts not in your control, practice saying "I release the need
                        to control this"</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <button>Start Guided Thought Dump</button>
        </div>

        <h2>Remember</h2>
        <p>Overthinking is a habit, not a personality trait. Like any habit, it can be changed with practice and
            patience. The storm in your mind is temporary, and you already have everything you need to find calm within
            it.</p>
