# Overthinking Relief Page
This page focuses on helping users break free from overthinking patterns with:

1. An interactive thought reframing tool with examples and text areas for users to practice
2. The 5-5-5 Reality Check technique to put worries in perspective
3. A breathing animation for quick mental reset
4. The Observer Technique to create distance from overwhelming thoughts
5. A Thought Dump & Transform exercise to convert rumination into action

The design uses calming colors with gradient blues and purples, with interactive elements that encourage users to engage rather than just read.
