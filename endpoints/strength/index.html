            <button onclick="toggleInfo('guts')">Guts</button>
            <div id="guts" class="info">Guts is searching endlessly for his life's task. He can't seem to find it, and
                all hope seems lost, until he finds his purpose in griffith. He is later betrayed in one of the most
                harrowing canon events, and dedicates himself to finding his love and enacting his revenge.</div>

        <div class="character">
            <button onclick="toggleInfo('goblin')">Goblin Slayer</button>
            <div id="goblin" class="info">On the outside, Goblin Slayer is methodical and relentless, proving that
                preparation and
                discipline lead to victory. Beyond this lies something deeper, a man struggling to become stronger than
                the weight of the sins that rest upon his shoulders.</div>

        <div class="character">
            <button onclick="toggleInfo('thorfinn')">Thorfinn</button>
            <div id="thorfinn" class="info">Thorfinn's journey begins with his father's end. He witnesses his father's
                death firsthand and vows to seek his revenge. He is so filled with hate that nothing else seems to
                matter. Eventually, the man who took his father's life is the one who helps Thorfinn to turn his own
                around. Thorfinn learns that a true warrior does not have any enemies, but rather must overcome himself.
                He overcomes his hate, returns home to his family, and becomes a true warrior.

            <button onclick="toggleInfo('asta')">Asta</button>
            <div id="asta" class="info">Asta is a character that by all means shouldn't amount to anything. Seemingly
                abandoned by the world, he has no right to dream. And yet, he does. He
                doesn't let his lack of innate ability stop him as he strives toward his dreams.</div>

            <div id="ouma" class="info">A character that embodies the essentialist lifestyle. Driven by his burning
                desire to prove himself as a fighter, he dedicates himself wholly to his life's task.</div>
