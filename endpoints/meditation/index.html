    <div id="method1" class="method">
        <h2>Focus on the Flame</h2>
        <p>Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a dark room with only the steady flame of a candle in front of you.
            Steady your breathing and focus on the flame. As you recognize your mind wandering, do not fret. Simply
            return to your mental image. Allow the steady flame to bring your mind peace.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="method2" class="method">
        <h2>Focus on a Grandfather Clock</h2>
        <p>Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a dark room accompanied by the steady oscillations of a grandfather
            clock. Let the rhythmic movement ground you in the present. As you recognize your mind wandering, do not
            fret. Simply
            return to your mental image. Allow the steady rhythm of the grandfather clock to bring your mind peace.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="method3" class="method">
        <h2>Focus on Breathing</h2>
        <p>Close your eyes and empty your mind best you can. As you recognize your mind wandering, do not fret. Simply
            return to your breathing. Feel your lungs fill and empty.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="method4" class="method">
        <h2>Box Breathing</h2>
        <p>Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and repeat.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="method5" class="method">
        <h2>Fog Island Visualization</h2>
        <p>Imagine yourself on an island surrounded by fog. Breathe in, and the fog moves in. Breathe out, and the fog
            recedes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="method6" class="method">
        <h2>Method from My Friend</h2>
        <p>Close your eyes. Breathe in for 5 counts, hold for 5 counts, exhale for 5 counts. Repeat for 7 seconds, 9
            seconds, and 11 seconds. After this, focus on things that your other senses can observe. What do you feel?
            What do you hear? What do you smell? If you're standing, can you feel your own weight on your feel? If
            you're sitting, can you feel your weight on the chair? Once you feel that you have become mindful, allow
            your mind to drift. As it drifts from idea, struggle, or stressor to idea, struggle, or stressor, mentally
            picture yourself taking each thought, and putting it into a box. Label the box, and remember that these
            things take time to deal with. Each box may be a different size, and try to figure out which boxes need to
            be unpacked the soonest, which can wait for a while, and which can wait indefinitely.</p>
