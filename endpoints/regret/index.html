                    <p>Regret is a complex emotion that can either propel us forward or hold us back:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Constructive Reflection</strong> - Using past mistakes as valuable learning
                            opportunities that guide better future decisions</li>
                        <li><strong>Destructive Dwelling</strong> - Getting stuck in a cycle of self-criticism and
                            shame that prevents personal growth</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The key is recognizing which form your regret is taking and redirecting it toward growth.</p>

                        <div class="step-title">Face It</div>
                        <p>Confront your regret directly instead of avoiding it. Acknowledge what happened, your
                            role in it, and the emotions it brings up. Facing regret requires courage, but it's the
                            essential first step toward healing.</p>

                        <div class="step-title">Fix It</div>
                        <p>Take actionable steps to address what went wrong. This might mean making amends, changing
                            behavior patterns, or developing new skills. Not everything can be fixed in the
                            traditional sense, but you can always work toward making peace with the past.</p>

                        <p>Transform the experience into something that strengthens you. Use the lessons learned to
                            create positive change in your life and possibly in others' lives. This is where regret
                            becomes a catalyst for growth rather than a burden.</p>

                <div class="exercise-title">Practical Exercise: Regret Reframing</div>
                <p>Take 10 minutes to work through this process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Write it down</strong> - Describe a regret you're currently experiencing</li>
                    <li><strong>Extract the lesson</strong> - What could this experience teach you?</li>
                    <li><strong>Identify one action</strong> - What's one thing you can do today that applies this
                        lesson?</li>
                    <li><strong>Commit to growth</strong> - How will you use this to become stronger?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Repeat this exercise whenever regret surfaces, gradually transforming it from a source of pain to
                    a source of wisdom.</p>
