                    things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste in your current environment.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Memory Palace</strong> - Pick a sequence of 10 random words and create a vivid mental
                    journey to remember them in order.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Skills Practice</strong> - Spend 10 minutes learning a small skill like juggling with
                    two objects, balancing a pencil on your finger, or learning a simple card trick.</li>
