            <h2>Social Anxiety Soundtrack</h2>
            <p>Create a confidence-boosting ritual before social situations:</p>
            <div class="playlist-container">
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a playlist of your favorite upbeat, confidence-boosting songs.</li>
                    <li>Before entering an anxiety-provoking situation, find a private space.</li>
                    <li>Play one song while striking "power poses" (hands on hips, standing tall with shoulders back).
                    </li>
                    <li>As you listen, imagine yourself handling the upcoming situation with ease.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> This combines music therapy with physical posture change to boost
                    confidence through both auditory and proprioceptive channels. Research shows that changing your
                    physical posture can actually shift your emotional state.</p>
