                <h2>Finding Your Direction: Goal Setting Guide</h2>
                <p>Goal setting is a skill that takes practice. If you're not sure where to start, this guide can help
                    you discover meaningful goals aligned with your purpose.</p>

                <div class="question-section">
                    <h3>1. Discovering Your Natural Talents</h3>
                    <p>According to Robert Greene in "Mastery," we all have natural inclinations that point toward our
                        life's work.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reflect on these questions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What activities did you enjoy as a child, before external pressures influenced you?</li>
                        <li>What tasks or subjects do you find yourself naturally drawn to?</li>
                        <li>When do you experience "flow" - where time seems to disappear?</li>
                        <li>What work would you do even if you weren't paid for it?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="question-section">
                    <h3>2. Identifying Your Values</h3>
                    <p>Goals aligned with your core values are more likely to motivate you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What principles are non-negotiable in your life?</li>
                        <li>When have you felt most proud of yourself?</li>
                        <li>What would you want people to say about you at your 80th birthday celebration?</li>
                        <li>What issues or causes move you emotionally?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="question-section">
                    <h3>3. Finding Your Ideal Future</h3>
                    <p>Visualization helps uncover meaningful goals.</p>
                    <p><strong>Imagine:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you had unlimited resources and couldn't fail, what would you do?</li>
                        <li>What does your ideal day look like 3 years from now?</li>
                        <li>What achievements would make you feel fulfilled?</li>
                        <li>What skills or knowledge would you love to master?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="question-section">
                    <h3>4. The "Apprenticeship Path" (from Mastery)</h3>
                    <p>Robert Greene suggests that mastery comes from a deep learning phase followed by creative
                        innovation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Consider:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What field or domain feels like it could be your "life's task"?</li>
                        <li>Who could be your mentors in this area?</li>
                        <li>What skills would you need to develop over the next 3 years?</li>
                        <li>How could you add your unique perspective to this field?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Start with one area</strong> that resonates most strongly with you. It's better to deeply
                    pursue one meaningful goal than to spread yourself thin across many.</p>
