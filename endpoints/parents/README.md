# Dealing with Parents Page
This page offers five different approaches to parent relationship challenges:

1. **Setting Boundaries** - With scripts, examples, and practical techniques
2. **Effective Communication** - Using "I feel" statements and active listening
3. **Building Independence** - Financial and emotional autonomy strategies
4. **Emotional Management** - The PAUSE method and quick regulation techniques
5. **Gaining Perspective** - Seeing current struggles as temporary and formative

The tabbed interface lets users choose what's most relevant to their situation. I've included interactive examples, scripts, and visual elements like the life timeline to help shift perspective.
